# Dynamic Memory Network Plus in Tensorflow

This is my implementaion of the super cool paper by Caiming Xiong, Stephen Merity, Richard Socher of MetaMind:
[DMN for Visual and Textual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01417)

Many many thanks to [@therne](https://github.com/therne/dmn-tensorflow) and [@barronalex](https://github.com/barronalex/Dynamic-Memory-Networks-in-TensorFlow) for sharing their code - very useful reference.

Gratitude to Richard Socher for sharing knowledge openly via cs224d and Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) via cs231n!
